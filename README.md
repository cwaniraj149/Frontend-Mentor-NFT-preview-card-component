## Overview

This project is a good start to using and enhancing one's HTML and CSS skills. The overall experience of doing this project is quite good.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

While doing this project, I learned about box-shadow.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  box-shadow: x-offset y-offset blur-radius spread-radius color; 
}
```


### Continued development

I am facing issues in box-shadow. I can't figure out how much blur and spread I should do. I also got stuck using flex property. So, I will clarify my concept about them and do better with them in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Rs2ND1ryYc&t=13485s) - This helped me in learning CSS. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
